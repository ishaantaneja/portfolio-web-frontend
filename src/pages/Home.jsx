  Welcome to my PortfolioðŸ‘‹ â€” I began my journey with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, complemented by a Minor in Big Data Analytics. During my time at university, I became actively involved with the Manipal Information Security Team, where I grew from a curious learner into a Board Member, shaping initiatives around cybersecurity.

While still pursuing my degree, I took on the role of Teacher Assistant at Coding Ninjas, where I taught Data Structures, Algorithms, and Data Analysis to aspiring developers. Teaching turned out to be a deeply fulfilling experienceâ€”it not only sharpened my own concepts but also gave me the joy of mentoring others.

After graduation, I stepped into the industry as a Backend Developer at Bank of America, where I got hands-on exposure to enterprise-level software development. Building on that foundation, I further expanded my skill set by joining the Google Cloud Cohort, strengthening my expertise in cloud technologies.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at EazyByts, where I continue to broaden my horizons by contributing to end-to-end application development while keeping my focus on speed, security, and scalability.  
  <br /><br />
  And nowâ€¦ youâ€™re looking at my portfolio â€” not just a website, but a working demo of my full-stack skills.  
  Built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), it ties together everything I enjoy: designing secure backends, building smooth frontends, and sprinkling in automation that makes life easier.  
  Iâ€™ve also built gaming projects and automation pipelines â€” because sometimes the best way to learn is to play, and the best way to work is to automate.  
  <br /><br />
  Beyond the code, I stay grounded through music, meditation, reading, and living a life of service.  
  For me, development isnâ€™t just about apps â€” itâ€™s about harmony: between tech and people, between creation and peace.
