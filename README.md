# Personal Portfolio - EazyByts Internship Project

Last week has been an ultra joyous week where I have developed my personal portfolio as a part of my project at **EazyByts** where I am currently serving as an intern.  

The portfolio has been made using the **MERN Stack** with full-fledged CRUD options for **Projects, Blogs, and Skills pages** through connection with the backend deployed using custom APIs, **Express.js** framework on **Node.js runtime**, and the **Atlas cloud extension of MongoDB** database.  

The frontend has been built using:
- **React.js**
- **Framer Motion** for animations, fades, and scroller-effect
- **TailwindCSS** (utility-first CSS for styling instead of semantic CSS files)
- **react-typed** for typing effects  

Moreover, **Git and GitHub** have been used for saving the states of the codebase and version controlling.

## Frontend Flow
The frontend component files render real-time responsive UI for multiple screen sizes (Mobile, Laptops, Tablets).  
They use **states** to store render information while being linked with service functions/custom APIs from the backend through a persistent connection based on asynchronous style connection established using **Axios**.  

An **Email Notification Service** is also added on the website so that anyone can connect with me.  
This has been established using **Nodemailer** utilizing the **Google Apps Password** for purpose-specific passwords (in this case → Gmail email notification via Contact Form on the Contact page).

## Development Journey
The entire week has been a journey filled with ups and downs.  
- **Ups:** ecstatic moments seeing the results of my focused work  
- **Downs:** literal downtimes of the website such as crashes, rendering errors, and small bugs creeping in during development

## Next Steps
My next steps are going to be based on the single-minded purpose of **deploying this website so that it can go live and reach real people out there in the world.**

✨ **Until Next Time!**
